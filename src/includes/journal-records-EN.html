      I’ve been preparing for this for nine months. For the past few days, I’ve been living with the thrilling sensation that the natural, familiar, and understandable flow of my
      life is about to be disrupted, and I will find myself in a completely different reality. The day after tomorrow, I will be sleeping in a chum, a raw-hide tent, and will spend
      the next 120 days in the tundra with a family of Nenets reindeer herders.

      Just a few months ago, while falling asleep in my warm, soft bed, I started to be momentarily seized by horror at the thought that I would be spending the next four months
      sleeping in the cold and would have to forget about warm showers. I don’t know why these feelings came to me just before bedtime, but by morning they were gone.

      Recently, I started playing the ancient game of Go. Its key feature is the enormous variability of moves. At the beginning of the game, when the board is empty, you can place
      your stones anywhere. But by the endgame, when there is little free space left, your options become limited. And the most interesting thing is that your final position is
      determined by your first moves, which might have been made quite randomly, and nothing can be changed anymore.
    </p>
    <p>Is our life like the game of Go? Can we somehow break the chains of events and circumstances that define and shape our lives?</p>

      As a child, I read a book about Genghis Khan, To the Last Sea. And I was struck to the core by the thought that one could spend one’s entire life moving toward an incredible,
      breathtaking goal — a kind of endless, boundless movement forward to conquer the whole vast world. But at a certain point I realized that I was journeying to the wrong sea.
      Now I’m heading for the Kara Sea.)

      I’m thinking about one’s attitude toward risk. In the tundra, you are responsible for yourself, and no one else. The day before yesterday, Artyom picked me up on the
      Salekhard-Nadym highway. He appeared out of the darkness. Out of some wild cold darkness. For a moment, I was terrified that I was going to go there. For a long time. I got
      on the snowmobile behind Artyom and we raced off. The shaking was violent. At first, I almost fell off, then I almost got hit on the head by a tree. You must think with your

      I woke up in the morning, and my breath was steaming. It was -35 degrees outside. I was facing a brutal inner crisis. I used to think that “a different life” was like
      something from movies and games. But it turned out to be a different life for real. And my whole essence, my ingrained habits, my need for a private space to sleep, that
      capricious freedom of choice, all those “I want this, I want that”, I want to order delivery or go for a walk, or go skateboarding at night or watch a TV series — all of that

      I realized that in the middle of the night, inside my sleeping bag, I’m seized by panic because there wasn’t enough space in there, and I wanted to break free. But outside
      the sleeping bag lies death — cold, frost, darkness. That means I have to stay there, I have no choice. I have to relax and accept it. I can’t just walk out of the chum. I
      have to exist within these circumstances. I have to sleep among everyone because it’s more efficient and warmer. I won’t survive alone at all. I must be in the community and
      the team.

      Survival. The Nenets are true survivalists. Yesterday, the guys left for Yar-Sale. It was a two-“Nenets-hour” trip, but it took six actual hours. Their capacity to endure
      difficulty is astounding — a profound, calm resilience and total acceptance.

      About the dangers. I’ve been to the corral where they sort the reindeer. No one told me that if you fall and a herd of reindeer is coming at you, you need to roll onto your
      back and cover your head with your hands. Otherwise, you can die, and people have died. You have to think for yourself. Use your head if you’re in the reindeer enclosure.

      <li>Pyek (“Little Forehead”, as there is a white stripe on his forehead) — 3 years old, male</li>

      I’m obviously going through the crisis of the first few days. Everything has piled up at once. And I have to accept it. The total lack of personal space. Eight people in a
      small chum, about four meters in diameter, plus five dogs. We all live in one half of it. You have to accept being constantly immersed in the tribe. There are always people
      around you — not just nearby, but right on next to you. We all sleep together. Back to back, to keep warm. I sleep between the old man and his son. We’ve already had a severe
      blizzard, with winds so strong they made the chum sway. And then the wind from the Arctic arrived, bringing a sudden frost of -35 degrees. Then came two days with granddad
      Vasya and his 2-year-old grandson, after all the women had left. For two days, we ate nothing but raw, fresh venison and white bread, just three times in two days. After
      that, I fell ill. The skin on my fingers is already cracked from the cold outside. My arm, the one I injured skateboarding, hurts. And going for a number two toilet break in
      a malitsa (deerskin parka) at minus 35 is a whole new experience.

      I woke up in the middle of the night, freezing in my sleeping bag, gripped by the terror of how tightly confined I was. But I couldn’t get out — because outside was the cold
      and the darkness, the snow and the ice (I’ve had a similar experience before on our winter hike). And I realized I had to calm down and accept the situation, to relax. That
      was the only way out: to accept the tight confines of the sleeping bag. Because there is no freedom of choice here.) The choice lies in whether you accept and relax, or you
      refuse to accept and simply panic.

      Reindeer have already started dying on Yamal. This is a real tragedy for the reindeer herder. A herd could have been raised over several generations and it could die due to a
      single seasonal change in the weather, or due to a single mistake, or a wrong strategy. The last time such a weather situation occurred was in 2014. An abnormally warm spring
      with frosts and black ice. Many reindeer died. I was told that one of the reindeer herders hanged himself because he couldn’t bear the loss of his herd. The reindeer are
      everything. They are status, meaning, prosperity, a source of pride, love, and joy for a reindeer herder.

      Surprisingly, the severe crisis of the first days has been replaced by a feeling of happiness. I’ve completely stopped being afraid of the four months ahead. My perception of
      time has changed. It has begun to flow in a calm and pleasant way. I catch myself thinking that I’m starting to accept the world like a reindeer-herding husky. If you have a
      chance to warm yourself by the stove, then warm yourself and enjoy the moment to the fullest, and don’t think about anything. And if you need to run, then run and enjoy the
      movement and the work. And sometimes, just look at the horizon.) It’s even surprising now that I had that crisis. Once again, I’m convinced of how much people lose when they
      turn back at the first shock of stepping outside their familiar comfort zone. It’s like when you come to the ocean early in the morning. The water is cold, the waves are

      I woke up at 7:40 — Grandpa had just arrived; they had been driving all night. For 12 hours, they were hauling supplies 200 km. On the way, the snowmobile broke down again —
      Artyom was going back, and Tolik and Galya stayed behind to sleep on the route; it was freezing in the tundra.

      Granddad. 70 years of age, his face all red — windburned. All night, he had to watch the road because of the ruts, the snow was like concrete, and they delivered the

    </p>
    <p>And I was in the settlement; question: should I have gone with them or not? I would have created risks for them, of course, and possible problems.</p>
    <p>
      And why do the Nenets need such complexities? Why such bestial determination? Because their lives depend on it. It’s like a wave. A big wave is coming at you; you either do
      the right thing or you don’t. You have to pull yourself together.
    </p>
    <p>Tolik and Galya flipped on their Buran snowmobile because of the icy pits; they were driving at night.</p>

      And the reindeer are life: I realized it there at the trading post at night — that food is warmth. Meat provides immediate warmth, and the fight against the cold is the

      The tundra demands constant vigilance. It is an elemental force, always. I heard a story about how untethered reindeer carried children away into the tundra in sleds, and
      they were never found. They would vanish into the boundless white horizon. Sleds were lost, people perished in the tundra because, on foot, there was no escape. They froze to
      death.

    <p>The tundra shows no mercy to the careless.</p>

      I recalled the words of Don Corleone: “A man must never be careless. His wife and children can afford to be, but a man cannot.” But in the tundra, neither the wife nor,

      What’s the current situation? The reindeer are on the southern side of the bay. On the winter pasture. It seems the grazing land there is almost exhausted. If we try to drive
      them somewhere, they will start moving north, scattering and always heading north. That’s their programming.

      Woke up at 2:30 a.m. because my feet were freezing. Badly. I was lying there thinking about what to do and quickly realized that I had a high fever. My whole body started
      shaking from the cold, my heart rate went up, and I became short of breath. I haven’t felt this bad in a long time (I honestly don’t even remember ever being in such a state
      from a cold). I lay there for about an hour — my thoughts were varied. It’s only the 5th of May, and the most difficult days are ahead — the daily migration to the north and
      the harsh, cold, and wet Arctic spring. But I no longer thought about running away. It’s like Everest now; you can’t just go back down. You just have to not panic, accept
      this path as an experience, and use your head. Why did I get so sick again, when I had just started to feel great?

      Friends, I want to immerse you in the current context. I am in difficult physical, weather, and psychological conditions. This has turned out not to be a guided tourist trip,
      but real extreme survival.) The day before yesterday, I drove a snowmobile with a sled for 8 hours in 18 m/s winds, with Galya, two kids, and four dogs (because there was no
      one else to do that). I was unlucky; I picked up a virus in the settlement, and for the last two days, I’ve been lying here with a temperature of 38-39.5°C. I guess my

      about warmth, sunshine, grass. The goal is June 10th, my birthday, I want the weather to be good. I want summer. I will count the days. I’ve realized that a month is actually

      Because of this in Zen nothing beats personal experience. Idea comprehension is impossible for someone with zero personal experience. It’s clear as a day. A child has no
      ideas, because her mind is yet unable to perceive the world through the lens of conceptual thinking. If a child had ideas, they would probably be totally absurd, ridiculous
      and out of touch with reality.

      Unless you let go of the observer effect — the constant construction of the context me — society — other people — you’ll keep separating yourself from others, which is the
      root of all ego. You separate yourself from the world. This modern world allowed us to construct a virtual self via Instagram, to create an image inside an image, an illusion
      inside an illusion, and now we care not only about how we look, but also about how our image/narrator is perceived on Instagram. Technical progress doesn’t matter as long as
      all the important questions are solved in the mind, and they’re still the same. Progress does affect us, sure it does — more and more people can think about something other
      than food now. The observer effect creates duality; the perception of the world as non-dual and perception of oneself as inseparable and one with the world is the way to Zen
      and enlightenment. It is what children and animals (possibly) have, it’s a flow — a flow of life. Another quality. Only by shedding the observer effect one can lead a
      different life, a Zen life.

      Unseeingly and unwittingly we’re all connected to olden times... It’s in our superstitions and instincts... The Nenets have it stronger than we do, they feel it as an
      umbilical cord leading back to ancient times.

      Uqnum/qanum is an independent existence, literally “self”. Syrian mystics often talk about seeing the beauty of their uqnum, which happens in a true encounter with oneself.
      When a person is sure that he is living his true life, he lets go of the need to compete with others.

      You have to concentrate in order not to lose things, because they are valuable and the further you take them, the more history they aссumulate, but if you lose them, let it
      be so. It means that you had to lose this particular thing: its time had come.

      If I did touch it at all, I did it with the very tip of my tongue. Just a little bit. I licked it, so to say. This is my limit for now. The most important thing is that I

      It all comes from childhood, I’m sure. Mom, why am I me? Who am I? What is my identity? experiencing the uniqueness of a concrete block in a panel house, of every pebble on
      the road — the whole world will keep on going, and the pebble will still be there when I die

      I used to think that anything that doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Your whole life prepares you for something bigger. This thought inspired me. It seemed that everything

      Why did I come here? To figure out human life and existence. Experience — observation — research. We see things from one perspective, but I wanted to climb another hill and
      see things from the opposite river bank. There are no direct answers, and I did not come here to find them. But I definitely understood a lot. My configurations are changing
      as I speak. The straightforward simple answer is too simple and only brings incomprehension.
