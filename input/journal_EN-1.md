March 20
I’ve been preparing for this for nine months. For the past few days, I’ve been living with the thrilling sensation that the natural, familiar, and understandable flow of my life is about to be disrupted, and I will find myself in a completely different reality. The day after tomorrow, I will be sleeping in a chum, a raw-hide tent, and will spend the next 120 days in the tundra with a family of Nenets reindeer herders.

March 20

Just a few months ago, while falling asleep in my warm, soft bed, I started to be momentarily seized by horror at the thought that I would be spending the next four months sleeping in the cold and would have to forget about warm showers. I don’t know why these feelings came to me just before bedtime, but by morning they were gone.

March 20

Recently, I started playing the ancient game of Go. Its key feature is the enormous variability of moves. At the beginning of the game, when the board is empty, you can place your stones anywhere. But by the endgame, when there is little free space left, your options become limited. And the most interesting thing is that your final position is determined by your first moves, which might have been made quite randomly, and nothing can be changed anymore.

Is our life like the game of Go? Can we somehow break the chains of events and circumstances that define and shape our lives?

March 21

As a child, I read a book about Genghis Khan, To the Last Sea. And I was struck to the core by the thought that one could spend one’s entire life moving toward an incredible, breathtaking goal — a kind of endless, boundless movement forward to conquer the whole vast world. But at a certain point I realized that I was journeying to the wrong sea. Now I’m heading for the Kara Sea.)

March 23

The shock of transitioning into a different reality — that’s how I felt on my first archaeological expedition back in 11th grade, where I ended up as a city smart boy. I woke up in the middle of the night. I’m in a chum. I can see my own breath. A wave of shock hit me. Horror coursed through my body. Five months of this await me.

March 23

I’m thinking about one’s attitude toward risk. In the tundra, you are responsible for yourself, and no one else. The day before yesterday, Artyom picked me up on the Salekhard-Nadym highway. He appeared out of the darkness. Out of some wild cold darkness. For a moment, I was terrified that I was going to go there. For a long time. I got on the snowmobile behind Artyom and we raced off. The shaking was violent. At first, I almost fell off, then I almost got hit on the head by a tree. You must think with your own head.

March 23

During my first days in the chum, I came to understand that time posed a real challenge. With the cold outside, you’re forced to find ways to occupy yourself within the tent. It quickly became clear: I couldn’t rely on my usual distractions. I have to just be with myself.

March 23

I’m here with Grandpa Vasya and little Vova; Mama Nadya isn’t coming. They’ve gone to Nadym. And they’re staying there overnight. Blizzard. Everything is loose and up in the air

March 24

I woke up in the morning, and my breath was steaming. It was -35 degrees outside. I was facing a brutal inner crisis. I used to think that “a different life” was like something from movies and games. But it turned out to be a different life for real. And my whole essence, my ingrained habits, my need for a private space to sleep, that capricious freedom of choice, all those “I want this, I want that”, I want to order delivery or go for a walk, or go skateboarding at night or watch a TV series — all of that is gone.

March 24

I realized that in the middle of the night, inside my sleeping bag, I’m seized by panic because there wasn’t enough space in there, and I wanted to break free. But outside the sleeping bag lies death — cold, frost, darkness. That means I have to stay there, I have no choice. I have to relax and accept it. I can’t just walk out of the chum. I have to exist within these circumstances. I have to sleep among everyone because it’s more efficient and warmer. I won’t survive alone at all. I must be in the community and the team.

March 24

Survival. The Nenets are true survivalists. Yesterday, the guys left for Yar-Sale. It was a two-“Nenets-hour” trip, but it took six actual hours. Their capacity to endure difficulty is astounding — a profound, calm resilience and total acceptance.

Yeah... I was thinking about the crisis in my sleeping bag this morning. The last two days were a crisis. The fear of a different life for real and also the fear of time.

And this longing for my loved ones — perhaps the central thing about that life.

I forgot how to be a hero. Looks like this journey will remind me.)

March 24

About the dangers. I’ve been to the corral where they sort the reindeer. No one told me that if you fall and a herd of reindeer is coming at you, you need to roll onto your back and cover your head with your hands. Otherwise, you can die, and people have died. You have to think for yourself. Use your head if you’re in the reindeer enclosure. That speaks volumes about the Nenets’ attitude toward risk and learning, I guess.

The same goes for kids — they have to figure things out on their own.

March 24

The dogs... there are so many of them. That’s a whole story in itself. You’ve got to find a way to tell them all apart. So, these are the dogs living in our chum at the moment:

- Sevok (“The Little Eye”) — white, 6 years old, male (well, that one’s easy to remember).
- Lapa (“Paw”) — black, 3 years old, male, granddad’s dog
- Imp — one year old, male, small and funny
- Nalto — black, one year old, male
- Pyek (“Little Forehead”, as there is a white stripe on his forehead) — 3 years old, male

My favourites are Imp — he’s gentle and tactful), and Sevok — a hedonist.

March 24

Nenets’ dogs:

- are intelligent
- and tactful
- they don’t beg
- they don’t fight
- and they don’t bark — they only growl
- they love to warm themselves by the stove.

March 25

I’ve never felt this bad before, honestly. There’s no escape. The thing that scares me the most is the thought of four months. I wake up every night in terror.) Maybe I’ll find the same kind of acceptance here that I found in business during those tough, impossible moments. There were times of sheer horror back then, too, when my thirst for adventure got me into difficult situations. But back then, I had no choice — I had to survive. Now, technically, there is a choice. I could run away.

March 25
I spent an entire year preparing, and now I should just give up?

What is it that frightens me? Why am I feeling this acute, piercing longing for my loved ones for the first time? I miss them incredibly. I want to spend every day with them. The Nenets are kind, but I feel like an outsider here. A total outsider. Will I ever become one of them?

The complete lack of personal space. There is none whatsoever. I don’t even have a place to put my things. And as for time — I have to come to terms with the fact that I must surrender to a different rhythm of life.

March 25

I’ve written so much about experience and existence, only to find I’m just a man who wants to see his son every day. I longed for a different life, and then I realized — there is no “other life”? There is only your own life?

March 25

I’m obviously going through the crisis of the first few days. Everything has piled up at once. And I have to accept it. The total lack of personal space. Eight people in a small chum, about four meters in diameter, plus five dogs. We all live in one half of it. You have to accept being constantly immersed in the tribe. There are always people around you — not just nearby, but right on next to you. We all sleep together. Back to back, to keep warm. I sleep between the old man and his son. We’ve already had a severe blizzard, with winds so strong they made the chum sway. And then the wind from the Arctic arrived, bringing a sudden frost of -35 degrees. Then came two days with granddad Vasya and his 2-year-old grandson, after all the women had left. For two days, we ate nothing but raw, fresh venison and white bread, just three times in two days. After that, I fell ill. The skin on my fingers is already cracked from the cold outside. My arm, the one I injured skateboarding, hurts. And going for a number two toilet break in a malitsa (deerskin parka) at minus 35 is a whole new experience.
Of course, I’ve already forgotten what a shower feels like. And I’ve realized that the power of sweat odour is greatly exaggerated — I don’t smell at all anymore.)

March 25

I woke up in the middle of the night, freezing in my sleeping bag, gripped by the terror of how tightly confined I was. But I couldn’t get out — because outside was the cold and the darkness, the snow and the ice (I’ve had a similar experience before on our winter hike). And I realized I had to calm down and accept the situation, to relax. That was the only way out: to accept the tight confines of the sleeping bag. Because there is no freedom of choice here.) The choice lies in whether you accept and relax, or you refuse to accept and simply panic.

March 25

This is a truly different life. In the end, this is exactly what I wanted. :)This isn’t a book about Arctic explorers; this is life itself. You just have to accept it, get used to it, adapt. I don’t have the strength to write much. I’m keeping very short notes. There is so much around me that is fascinating and captivating, and I’m filming a lot. But the thoughts I write about never leave me.

March 25

Is it that the Nenets never complain about life because they don’t know any other life? Or is it because they are content with their own lives? As long as there is something to eat.

March 25

The Nenets don’t talk about what’s already clear. When should I put lunch for my wife? When will we be back from the tundra? And when? Well, nobody knows. We’ll see. So much is communicated through the air, not through words — it’s a kind of body language.

March 25

All my attempts to engage the Nenets in philosophical conversations failed, as they perceived such questions as utterly meaningless. Why talk about death? It’s already understood. Why talk about what ultimately cannot be expressed in words? Life is arranged this way, and one must simply live it.

Another thing: the Nenets never get bored. You’re either resting or working: catching geese, fishing, tending to the reindeer.

March 25

Probably the peak of the crisis hit in the first two days. By the third, it began to subside. Today is the fourth day. A sense of acceptance is setting in, coming through a kind of apathy — or maybe it’s not apathy, just resignation to fate.)

March 25

Question: How does one change their underwear in the chum in winter, when there are always people inside, including the women who are the keepers of the home?

It’s a quest.

March 25

One Nenets man came to visit and said, “I’ve found a hundred of my lost reindeer. That’s my food taken care of for the whole year.”

March 26

The dogs from different chums are hostile towards each other. If you go to another chum, they bark at you because you’re not from their chum.) I was attacked by dogs, but then Lapa (grandpa’s doggie) came to my rescue. The dogs here are really amazing, I tell you.

March 26

Obviously, the crisis is subsiding. I began to get used to the situation and accept it. My stomach, too, has adapted. I began to get used to the rhythm, the daily routine. Tea, forest, playing chess with granddad, firewood, kids. Dogs.

The crisis of the first few days is the transition from a life of daily cottage-cheese pancakes delivered from CoffeeMania, on-demand massages, and a generally relaxed, controlled existence — into a chum.

March 26

> “It is the only form of adventure in which you put on your clothes at Michaelmas and keep them on until Christmas, and, save for a layer of the natural grease of the body, find them as clean as though they were new.”

_The Worst Journey in the World: Apsley Cherry-Garrard_

March 27

An ode to humanity: to the Nenets ancestors who reached Yamal, mastered it, created this system, who suffered and died; to Scott and Amundsen, to everyone. No person’s life is in vain. Together, we are creating something. Together.

Massive respect to the Nenets for their survival system and way of life. They have no idea how awesome they are.)

March 27

The first crisis is over.

I’ve surrendered and accepted this new reality. :) It’s funny, I didn’t expect a crisis like that, but I guess it was inevitable when you’re thrown from a world where you can order cottage-cheese pancakes from CoffeeMania at 6 a.m. and leave your house literally any time you feel like it.

March 27

I guess this kind of crisis was inevitable.

And then there’s the feeling and the dread of time—five months lying ahead. I’ve come to terms with time. I’ve accepted that I won’t see my loved ones for five months, although I used to think it would be easier. Apparently, those first days brought a powerful, stark awareness of the full length of this term. I’ve accepted time — it simply has to flow. I just need to live. I have to accept that this is my life now.

March 27

I’ve started to adapt, to survive in my own way, to create my own comfort. Now my personal little haven is a corner inside the chum where I can be with my gadgets and laptop, or just lie down with a book, even while there might be ten other people around.

March 27

I’ve sorted out my diet. I’ve started creating my own daily routine (haha, and we haven’t even started migrating with the reindeer yet). Now I sleep in my yagushka, and it’s a whole new level of comfort. I’m filming a lot. Jotting down very brief notes. And in this diary, for now, I’m just tracking the shifts in my state of mind.

You know what else helped me a ton, haha?) I started reading the book about Robert Scott’s last expedition, The Worst Journey in the World, and I suddenly felt much better. It’s incredibly motivating.

March 27

Of course, I knew I couldn’t go back. It would have been impossible; I would have simply betrayed my dream because of a crisis in the first few days — that’s just unthinkable! I knew it would pass, that I just had to wait it out, endure it, and readjust. There’s no way back to the Kara Sea unless it’s on an emergency medical helicopter.

March 27

I have to embrace this different life. In fact, this is exactly what I wanted — everything is real now. I must stop resisting it and start living differently.

It seems I’ve already passed the first trial. Not much time has passed, but news from that other world feels distant. I haven’t known what’s happening in the world for a week now, except for what the reindeer herders might tell me. But generally, they’re more interested in the weather forecast for the next few days and the likelihood of black ice than in news from another world. :)

March 27

An amusing observation: it turns out that the smell of sweat in the morning, after not washing for a week and wearing the same T-shirt, resembles the scent of fresh wormwood in the summer steppe.)

But I’ll contextualize this fact with a quote from the book about Scott:

“Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised. It is the only form of adventure in which you put on your clothes at Michaelmas and keep them on until Christmas, and, save for a layer of the natural grease of the body, find them as clean as though they were new.”

March 27

Yes, food is, after all, a fundamental pleasure in life and a powerful motivator — especially when it’s well-earned, and your mealtimes are constrained by work.

March 29

Day 8

I slept well — the whole night.

I barely sweated, which is strange — I guess I just got used to it.

Why did I have a crisis?

Acclimatization to a different life.

This is only the beginning — tomorrow is the first migration)

I’m in a very calm state right now. Like a cat or a dog. It’s good to have tea. It’s good when it’s warm and the food is tasty. It’s good when we play chess. It’s good to read a book. No anxiety. No news. No politics.

Alik called - it’s raining in Yar-Sale. That’s bad. Now that’s important news. The reindeer will be staying here for a long time.

Now it’s started raining heavily here too. The reindeer herders say this is the first time something like this has ever happened. It threatens a catastrophe.

Frost is better than dampness and rain. Frost means dryness.

March 30

It’s very warm. Everyone is sinking into the snow.

+5 degrees. The migration has been postponed. Until tomorrow.
Artyom says it has never been this warm before. Black ice and water.

March 30

These are glimpses, waves, and echoes of how our ancestors lived. Survival. Sharing meals together. No time to be sad. We must live.

March 31

A person generally needs very little.) I’ve been wearing one T-shirt for 10 days now! I realized how many unnecessary things I have brought with me.)

April 2

Reindeer have already started dying on Yamal. This is a real tragedy for the reindeer herder. A herd could have been raised over several generations and it could die due to a single seasonal change in the weather, or due to a single mistake, or a wrong strategy. The last time such a weather situation occurred was in 2014. An abnormally warm spring with frosts and black ice. Many reindeer died. I was told that one of the reindeer herders hanged himself because he couldn’t bear the loss of his herd. The reindeer are everything. They are status, meaning, prosperity, a source of pride, love, and joy for a reindeer herder.

April 2

The Nenets age quickly. The wind and the cold. The beauty of the Nenets is fleeting, and that’s what makes it even more beautiful. Like melting snow. One must live. It’s not about these attempts to remain young.

Say “yes” to adventure. Say “yes” to challenges.

An important rule: dry your feet.

April 2

What about my condition?

Surprisingly, the severe crisis of the first days has been replaced by a feeling of happiness. I’ve completely stopped being afraid of the four months ahead. My perception of time has changed. It has begun to flow in a calm and pleasant way. I catch myself thinking that I’m starting to accept the world like a reindeer-herding husky. If you have a chance to warm yourself by the stove, then warm yourself and enjoy the moment to the fullest, and don’t think about anything. And if you need to run, then run and enjoy the movement and the work. And sometimes, just look at the horizon.) It’s even surprising now that I had that crisis. Once again, I’m convinced of how much people lose when they turn back at the first shock of stepping outside their familiar comfort zone. It’s like when you come to the ocean early in the morning. The water is cold, the waves are rough, and a soft part of you tells you to go home to bed. But when you enter the ocean, after half an hour or an hour, you feel an

incredible, magical happiness. A crisis is a gateway to a new world.)

April 2

I am looking at an old Nenets woman and I understand how much people have gone through so that we could live the way we do now – the efforts of thousands of generations since the Paleolithic age. So much effort, so many lives, so much suffering, so that we could create all of this. Together.

April 8

I’m staying in the settlement.
Albert is going to Aksarka for groceries.
Uncle Vasya, Artyom, Galya, Tolik, and Nadya are driving 200 kilometres away — to deliver groceries and firewood to future campsites. Thoughtfully planned.

April 8

The North means distances. You constantly have to go somewhere and cover distances that take many hours. Today, the guys are going to deliver firewood and food 200 km to the north and back — a total of 400 km on snowmobiles across the tundra…

April 8

The Nenets’ schedule is very flexible. The answer to all questions about a precise time is the same: “We’ll see.” We need to travel 200 km, but in the end, we haven’t left yet by one o’clock in the afternoon…

April 9

Morning

I woke up at 7:40 — Grandpa had just arrived; they had been driving all night. For 12 hours, they were hauling supplies 200 km. On the way, the snowmobile broke down again — Artyom was going back, and Tolik and Galya stayed behind to sleep on the route; it was freezing in the tundra.

Granddad. 70 years of age, his face all red — windburned. All night, he had to watch the road because of the ruts, the snow was like concrete, and they delivered the supplies. They froze. Now he’s sleeping.

And I was in the settlement; question: should I have gone with them or not? I would have created risks for them, of course, and possible problems.

And why do the Nenets need such complexities? Why such bestial determination? Because their lives depend on it. It’s like a wave. A big wave is coming at you; you either do the right thing or you don’t. You have to pull yourself together.

Tolik and Galya flipped on their Buran snowmobile because of the icy pits; they were driving at night.
The old man was thrown from the snowmobile, and it’s a good thing, he says, that it didn’t flip over onto him, or he would have died. That’s just simple everyday life.

April 9

The Nenets constantly have to make decisions and rely only on themselves.
There is a kind of primal readiness to overcome difficulties without hesitation — the words “don’t feel like” do not exist.

April 11

Everything is constantly tested for strength, for the limits of endurance and viability — the snowmobiles (mercilessly pushed to their limits), their own bodies, the dogs, the heavy loads... But the ultimate test of “endurance” is the struggle against the elements for the sake of the reindeer, that is life itself.

And the reindeer are life: I realized it there at the trading post at night — that food is warmth. Meat provides immediate warmth, and the fight against the cold is the Nenets’ primary instinct. Because they will risk their lives, but they will wear their malitsa.

April 11

The tundra demands constant vigilance. It is an elemental force, always. I heard a story about how untethered reindeer carried children away into the tundra in sleds, and they were never found. They would vanish into the boundless white horizon. Sleds were lost, people perished in the tundra because, on foot, there was no escape. They froze to death.

The tundra shows no mercy to the careless.

I recalled the words of Don Corleone: “A man must never be careless. His wife and children can afford to be, but a man cannot.” But in the tundra, neither the wife nor, often, the children can afford carelessness.

April 11

It’s astonishing that the Nenets fear the cold more than vast distances or hard labour. If you have no clothing, the cold is invincible. They know this. The warmth of clothing isn’t just about not feeling cold for 30 minutes outside. It’s about being able to sleep in your clothes in the snow. Or to ride a snowmobile for ten hours.

April 11

A Different Life

The most valuable experience: why not go and see a different life? A real one! A completely different one. Why is my life the benchmark, the main one? The world of a little bug 🐜 is vast, and that’s just on a single tree. )) And yet we think our world is the main one, our universe.

This is an important thought, after all.

We live in our own information bubble, in our own little world. Why are these particular values considered the most important? What truly matters to people? Here, the priorities are different for sure — absolutely so, despite the creeping stains of global civilization. That civilization simply isn’t as important here.

April 12

What’s the current situation? The reindeer are on the southern side of the bay. On the winter pasture. It seems the grazing land there is almost exhausted. If we try to drive them somewhere, they will start moving north, scattering and always heading north. That’s their programming.
So, if we move, we will have to follow the reindeer and keep watch at night to prevent them from scattering. And move to the north; we need areas with thawed snow.

What “death zones” are there?

1. The Gulf of Ob
2. From Ports-Yakha to the “Northern Depot”. 70 km. There are no thawed patches there. The old man calls it the “Valley of Death”.

The old man is calm; he has seen a lot. Nobody is panicking at all. But you can tell this is a critical moment.

Somewhere, wars and revolutions were raging, while they kept driving the reindeer north and back again, in an endless cycle. The reindeer must move.

April 12

Watch yourself — be cautious.

April 13

Let’s say you get sick. A reindeer herder can’t press pause on anything — you must go and do what must be done. The reindeer are moving north; otherwise, it’s death. And you need your family, helpers, your wife. You can’t manage alone. You need the team.

April 13
I feel the joy of being a child and learning to walk again. Life is a discovery. I feel like a child, and it’s so wonderful.

April 15

It’s simply impossible to live alone here. The wind howls outside the chum walls, and the rain mixes with snow. It’s profoundly dreary. But over tea, when everyone is together, it’s good.

April 15

What do the Nenets discuss?

1. The weather
2. Snowmobiles
3. Reindeer

April 17

Not even a month has passed yet.

And all the most difficult parts are still ahead.

I’m reading White Fang — it’s about wolves: to live in order to eat, to eat in order to live. Essentially, that’s how the Nenets live too... and how else could it be? This is part of the natural order.

April 18

A very cold night.
Grandad said it was -30 outside.
The water froze in the chum, and the butter was rock-hard at breakfast.
I slept in my malitsa, tobaks, and quilted jackets, and I was still cold at times.
For some reason, it’s hard to fall asleep — it’s as if your consciousness always refuses to shut down because there’s a fear you’ll freeze to death.) Every night, it takes me a very long time to fall asleep.
It looks like we’ll be staying here until the end of April, and then we’ll be migrating at a frantic pace.
Galya, of course, is absolutely amazing! 7 children, 48 years old, not a single gray hair, a clean chum, clean plates, and she cooks so well. But Vlad is good too — hardworking, kind, I haven’t seen anything bad from him so far.

Tolik injured his eye, but they didn’t give him a day to rest — he has to go, to work; he has to go. In general, there are two key words for the Nenets: “must” and “endure”.

April 18

The Kara Sea is somewhere very far away... It’s incredible; it’s only five months, yet there’s so much ahead, and it’s frightening.)

April 18

I’m frightened by the five months and by my longing for my old life and my loved ones. I simply have to cut off the old life. I can’t maintain it. Cut it off for a while, of course. Because if you keep living that other life, you’ll be consumed by melancholy. You have to plunge entirely into the current context.

April 19

I’m walking along, listening to Lana Del Rey, and I see the Nike logo on Tolik’s T-shirt, and I feel the connection of all people — no, not just people, of everything).

April 19

Every single object in the tundra is made by somebody’s hands — labour is invested in it: the clothing, the tynzyan (lasso), even the toilet paper made from birch bark... The sensations this evokes are completely different. And yet, there’s so much you simply cannot make yourself, which gives everything a different kind of value.

April 19

Day 29, or one month since I left Moscow.
The weather is changing drastically.
Last night was bitterly cold.
Then, by evening, it warmed up.
After that, it was a rather cold night.
This morning, the sun was shining and it was warm.
And now, a strong wind has picked up. It’s cold again, and the chum is swaying.

April 19

Gasoline for the snowmobile is the most important thing in the tundra — it must not run out. It’s like Mad Max, only in a snowy desert.

April 19

For the Nenets, reindeer are what land is for other peoples. They are passed down as inheritance. People die for them.
Why do we accept when people die over patches of land, yet fail to understand this same significance of reindeer for the Nenets... Reindeer are everything; they are their pride...

April 19

Like drops of blood, remote ages seep through everything here — not the Middle Ages, but something even more ancient… from the time when our ancestors were settling the land, and the Nenets were cast to the edge of the world, to the frontier.
They have snowmobiles and phones today, but I can hear the waves of humanity’s past when we all drink the reindeer’s blood together, sitting around a freshly skinned carcass.

April 19

Dampness and cold again. A nagging cold, a tongue of dampness penetrating through the holes in the chum... the wind.

April 19

Everyone got sick. Even Grandad got badly chilled — they’ve laid him down at the very edge, which is apparently the traditional place for the parents.

April 20

The weather changes every few hours.
Morning — sunshine and fluffy snow.
During the day — sunshine and heat.
Then a blizzard again, a strong wind, from the north.
I’m back in the chum.
Grandad is sick.
Vitka is being annoying.
Galya works every minute.

April 20

You’re lying in a warm place, and that’s a perfect thing.

April 20

The reindeer are dying of hunger — because of the weather, in the 21st century. Protected by people, adapted to the cold, yet dying because there is no reindeer lichen (yagel). We have forgotten what it means to live in order to eat, and to eat in order to live.

April 23

Yesterday, they drove the reindeer from the pastures to the chum. There was a blizzard all day. I was sick. Today, I feel worse. My job was to block the road.
I coughed heavily during the night. Today, I’ve been left alone in the chum. While I was sleeping and having tea, everyone else went to lasso their reindeer from the herd of “Turovich,” our neighbour. I didn’t go. I decided to rest and recover.
Yesterday there was a blizzard, yet the temperature was only down to -5. The night was warm; I overheated in that damned sleeping bag :( so I got dressed and again slept just in my clothes. I put on everything I had — my down jacket, and my quilted jackets.

There was a powerful north wind in the morning — I woke up at 6 a.m. because Tolik and Artem went to check on the reindeer (around 4 a.m.), without even having tea. They are afraid the reindeer will move north and won’t calm down. Yesterday, we only returned late at night — around 10:00 p.m. So, this is the kind of schedule that’s starting.

I’ve started thinking precisely in the here and now. The rest of the world is somewhere far away. Or even... life itself. My world is these people right now.

Last night, while coughing, I thought again about the difficulty of the upcoming migrations. I so desperately wanted to rest for just one day...

April 23

The Nenets and their reindeer share a powerful symbiosis; they eat them and protect them. The reindeer would certainly not survive without the Nenets (who guard them, drive them to new pastures, and watch over calves without mothers), and the Nenets could not survive without the reindeer (from their blood as a source of vitamins to clothing and the chum).

To live in order to eat, and to eat in order to live.

April 23

Artem returned from visiting friends. He says they only eat cookies, don’t slaughter their reindeer because they feel sorry for them, and want to have more reindeer!

April 23

You need reindeer to buy a snowmobile, and you need the snowmobile to repair it and graze the reindeer, and then to buy yet another snowmobile.

All the people I have seen here are occupied, found, not lost. They have everything — their relatives, reindeer, purpose. They are happy, despite the hardships. And these hardships bind them so strongly together.

The Nenets have many children, and children are a joy.

April 24

For a whole month, the lack of personal space never made me uncomfortable. Maybe humans are naturally comfortable living together, like in the Paleolithic age.

The story about Amundsen feeding dogs to other dogs was met with complete understanding by the Nenets).

April 24

It’s like I’m blind and I’m just starting to tactilely feel the face of a new person, trying to understand it, but my hands are frozen in the cold, this face is this other life.

April 25

I’m sick — I haven’t gotten better, I’ve gotten worse. My nose is running down my throat :(
I wonder how long recovery will take) ❤️‍🩹 A week or more?
At least I’m sleeping okay.

April 25

Waiting... Almost a month in one place, the wind is blowing, the chum is swaying, and I’m sick...
I live like a husky :) waiting.
Waiting for the movement to the north.

How I long to go surfing.)

April 26

Tolik and Artem arrived from Yar-Sale in the morning and said abruptly: We’re migrating today. 130 km, towards Yar-Sale, across the bay, because a heavy blizzard is coming on the April 29 and we need to wait it out over there…

We’re migrating today!

April 26

We are migrating!!!

I am gradually forgetting my past life: business, Putin, Trump — it all feels so far away.

I feel like a child here) I can’t do anything properly — I am clumsy.

Reindeer are very similar to humans:

1. They all have different personalities.
2. Some go forward and perish, but this is necessary for the herd.
3. A collective mind.
4. There are leaders — and more than one.
5. Everyone is running, so I run too.
6. It seems like chaos, yet something seems to be moving — the drive to go north, a “swarm movement”.

Reindeer are profoundly beautiful; they are a force of nature — it’s as compelling as surfing.

The Nenets and the reindeer share a symbiosis. The Nenets love their reindeer deeply, showing them far more tenderness than they do their dogs, it seems.

I’ve come to appreciate good books more; I’ve developed a desire to read poetry — what a profound treasure it is.

April 28

I sometimes doubt, as if I’m not sure if it’s really me here, or not me — such is the unreality of what’s happening. I had a dream: I was standing somewhere in the middle of the frozen Ob River, and it was incredibly beautiful and terrifying at the same time.

April 28

We were driving the reindeer across the Ob River — Uncle Vasya, who is immortal, and his faithful Lapa. And also, the sheer scale, and that ancient, tribal feeling once again... These are the main impressions I want to preserve above all.

How incredibly awesome Tolik is — he came to rescue us after two days of migration (he hadn’t slept, he was frozen), and nobody even bats an eye about it — and Galya, the woman who gave birth to Tolik, and the Person who has mastered this harsh North and the entire world!

April 29

I can eat reindeer brains without a second thought, because I already inhabit a different reality; back in the city, an eye in my plate would have unsettled me.

April 29

I constantly forget the following things: (1) the meaning of life is in life itself, in experience, which is to say, in development and in gaining wisdom — the experience, the opportunity to become better; (2) to create something for other living beings; (3) not to deceive others and myself. Does freedom mean the possibility of gaining experience?

April 30

It’s so fucking awesome when the sun is out and you’re basking in it.

April 30

To go to a place where you are nobody, and for the Nenets, I am nobody.

> So that no one would call me by my name
> So that they couldn’t find me with a candle in broad daylight
> Ash and dust, a big zero
> And no one to check off in the column

The state of being when I realize I’m right here, right in the “movie” — having placed myself into this amazing situation.
