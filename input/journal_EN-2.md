May 1

We live in a world of illusions. The rulers of the world have built their own illusion. From here, I can see that it is an illusion.

May 1

What’s spinning in my head:

- an ancient connection to ancient humanity.
- a world war, we will destroy each other — is this what humanity was developing for?
- what do I need money for?

May 5

A difficult day

Woke up at 2:30 a.m. because my feet were freezing. Badly. I was lying there thinking about what to do and quickly realized that I had a high fever. My whole body started shaking from the cold, my heart rate went up, and I became short of breath. I haven’t felt this bad in a long time (I honestly don’t even remember ever being in such a state from a cold). I lay there for about an hour — my thoughts were varied. It’s only the 5th of May, and the most difficult days are ahead — the daily migration to the north and the harsh, cold, and wet Arctic spring. But I no longer thought about running away. It’s like Everest now; you can’t just go back down. You just have to not panic, accept this path as an experience, and use your head. Why did I get so sick again, when I had just started to feel great?

I have had two days of a very difficult journey (for me).

May 5

Uncle Vasya is a very simple man, but around people he keeps his distance. After all, he is a patriarch, a highly respected Nenets, and the other Nenets wouldn’t understand if he were to communicate with me so easily.

May 5

“You mustn’t pick up the stones — there will be a blizzard!” Galya said to Kolya.

May 5

Actually, the Nenets are completely uninterested in our lives. No one has ever asked me anything with genuine curiosity. Who I am and what I am... Perhaps they don’t ask, but only form an opinion based on actions. Actually, no one has ever spoken about abstract topics. They are focused on their own world, on the action of now and tomorrow.

May 5

The fever is hard to bring down. Ibuсlin didn’t help; it stayed at 39.4 °C. Then I took Ibuprofen, and after an hour it dropped to 38. It hasn’t dropped any lower all day. So, I’ve taken two pills, but Ibuprofen used to help before. I’ve noticed that when I’m lying down, there’s a heaviness (discomfort) in my left hypochondrium, near the lower back. I don’t know if it’s important or not. For now, that’s how it is.

May 6

Yesterday evening, the satellite didn’t want to pick up the Internet (.  
In the evening, the temperature was 39.4.  
Ibuklin didn’t help; it stayed at 39.4. Then I took Ibuprofen, and after an hour it dropped to 38. I slept better at night than the night before. At 4 a.m. — 37.8 (a record low!), but in the morning at 8 it was 38.1 and at 10 a.m. — 37.6! Probably, things are getting better. During the night, I had a runny nose, my nose got stuffy (it wasn’t before), and my throat hurt a little, specifically when swallowing (it doesn’t tickle).

May 6

Friends, I want to immerse you in the current context. I am in difficult physical, weather, and psychological conditions. This has turned out not to be a guided tourist trip, but real extreme survival.) The day before yesterday, I drove a snowmobile with a sled for 8 hours in 18 m/s winds, with Galya, two kids, and four dogs (because there was no one else to do that). I was unlucky; I picked up a virus in the settlement, and for the last two days, I’ve been lying here with a temperature of 38-39.5°C. I guess my weakened immune system is failing.(

May 7

To survive in the tundra, you must keep moving — otherwise, you’ll freeze to death.

May 7

The way the Nenets live is the way the pioneers, the frontiersmen, the conquerors of Siberia and Alaska lived...

May 7

I’ve stopped counting the days for now.) I’ll count them later.  
It’s very cold because it’s humid — we are in a fog, in a cloud, on a stony hill, some ancient mountain. All elevated places are, as a rule, sacred to the Nenets, since the tundra is flat.

My feet are freezing for the first time this entire trip — in the tobaks, because I didn’t dry them out from overnight. Conclusion: you have to constantly dry everything. Moisture = cold.

The Nenets religion is superstitions), taboos, and meaningless actions because “that’s how it’s done.” There is no deep philosophy in the “religion” itself. There are some Nenets who are Baptists — interesting.

It’s so fucking awesome to read. And also, I’m having these incredible lucid dreams. I understand that I’m dreaming, I feel good, warm, and I can control everything — and I go to places where I feel good: warmth, women).

Well, okay, the main news for the 7th of May: now we have no Internet! This is a different life indeed.

May 7

Ilya has to return earlier because there is no one else to lead the argish (caravan) — they are counting on Ilya. Ilya is 12 years old, and Ilya has had his appendix removed.

May 7

Well, alright, the main thing for May 7th: now we have no Internet! This is a different life — now I understand the value of content. How I’ve fallen in love with paper books — with all my soul — they transport me far away... they help, I communicate with all of humanity through Jack London.

May 7

How I love sitting by the stove :)

May 7

The art of not freezing is the science of not sweating. If you sweat — you’ll have to dry off later :) You sweat, which means you get wet, which means — you get cold. Therefore, European clothing is not suitable. It’s not designed for long periods in the cold. And it mostly doesn’t breathe.

May 7

First, I stopped understanding what day of the week it was, then I got lost in the time of day and hung suspended in constant motion between the strip of the sky and the tundra.

May 7

I saved Lapa, who was tied up in the wind and cold, but as soon as he was untied, he immediately went to pester the female dog Betty, who was walking around, and for that, he was tied up again by Galya.)

May 8

Here, it’s impossible to not go to school, to quit your job. If the migration is necessary, you must migrate in any condition and in any weather. And you can’t exit the game.)

May 8

Friends, I feel much better. The fever is gone. Only a runny nose remains. There were three days of fog and then a blizzard, it’s humid, cold at night, there’s no firewood — only enough for tea and food. A very unpleasant season, the reindeer herders say.) We have to hold on until the warm weather.)

May 8

The cold. There’s no escaping it. Now, when it’s humid and the snow is melting, the sensation of cold is much greater than during the frost. I’m freezing in the chum. The tongues of cold are licking me.

May 8

A crucial insight: I must completely let go of my past life and start living the life of the present — not whine, not miss things, not suffer, but live this life fully. Why are the Nenets content with their life? Because they don’t know any other. So I, too, must forget that other life. Accept.

May 7

At first, I would say “bless you” to the Nenets when they sneezed, but they would respond with silence. Then I said it again, and they were silent again. I stopped saying it. Then I understood: they remove everything that is superfluous. Galya told me how some “lutsa” (Russian) came to visit them and in the morning asked her: “How did you sleep?” Galya said to me: “Does he have nothing to talk about or what?”

May 8

The Nenets are a culture of survival. Calm survival. “We don’t know any other life” — Galya. So, Artyom was born a Nenets, so what is he to do. The reindeer got mixed up, two herds, it’s a big problem actually — you can panic, you can freak out, but it won’t change anything — you have to act, to “work”.

May 9

It’s difficult to expect tenderness towards dogs from the Nenets when they don’t have tenderness towards themselves. Here, Artyom and Tolik returned yesterday — for two days they drove a “piece” of the herd that had broken off (after first lassoing it), for two days through the “valley of death” in a blizzard and fog, in the rain, soaked, they slept on the way, Tolik woke Artyom so he wouldn’t get frostbite in his feet. So Artyom arrived in the evening and just went to sleep in his wet socks to the howling of the wind... and in the morning got up and went to work as if nothing had happened — an ordinary day... To expect them to worry deeply about the dogs outside in this context...) Well, they do bring them into the chum for the night...

May 10

There is no comfort zone, there’s nothing to step out of.)

May 10

The spectrum of pleasures has narrowed down to tea, bread with butter, the stove, and sound sleep...

May 10

I realized that it’s not worth dreaming about something distant, about cottage-cheese pancakes with cappuccino or a soft bed. You should dream about what’s close — simply about warmth, sunshine, grass. The goal is June 10th, my birthday, I want the weather to be good. I want summer. I will count the days. I’ve realized that a month is actually fast.)

May 10

Three rules:

1. Don’t lose body heat.
2. Don’t sweat.
3. Dry your feet.

May 10

Are there any thoughts about that other life? No.) Almost none.

May 10

And what is happening to my ego? My ambition? It’s as if it has shrivelled up from the cold and become so transparent.

May 11

At night, there was a strong wind and about -15 to -20, as the old man says.  
During the day, the wind died down, but it’s still minus, overcast. The water in the washbasin inside the chum froze...  
Vlad went to catch Pedava’s and Pavel’s (they are relatives; one of them is married to Galya’s niece) reindeer. And at night, he was guarding the reindeer that want to run away to the north.

We are waiting for Galya, Tolik, and Artyom (and Vitya, and apparently Nyadma, Artyom’s son) to return from the settlement, and tomorrow we’re already breaking camp, migrating to the north (and I think Roma will be there too, since he and Tolik are going to deliver a quad bike to Bovanenkovo).  
It seems like from May 14th there will be a warming trend, but they’re scaring me with the prospect of frequent rain and sleet…

This morning, I lit the stove myself, made tea for everyone, and toasted bread for everyone. Dashka (Artyom’s daughter) is a terrible lazybones :), she doesn’t help at all. When everyone arrived for tea, they thought Dashka had made it.)

I’m almost fully recovered. How can I avoid getting sick again?) I need the right clothing strategy.

May 11

My problem is that I am suffering right now, and I need to get rid of the suffering.  
I am cold, and I remember when it was warm. I must accept that it is cold now. I have no choice, but I can compare things.  
Galya: We don’t know any other life.

May 11

I am walking through the tundra and saying: Who am I? Why am I me? Why wasn’t I born a reindeer herder? Could I have managed to get out? Would I be able to think? What is the meaning of our life? Is there one? To drive reindeer? Why am I the way I am, and they are different?  
Life is a treasure. It is a mystery.

May 11

I am still very much attached to my ego and ambition. I cling to youth, to the desire to possess all the women in the world. To vanity. I think about the film, and that is vanity.

May 11

Does my crisis consist in wanting entertainment? Pleasures, and there are none here — I have to be with myself? But there is also simply suffering) Here, you have to learn how to survive.

May 12

I have no personal space. My personal space is the tundra.  
I am subordinate to the rhythms of the family. Of the tribe. You go off to sleep when everyone goes off to sleep.

May 12

It’s cold  
Overcast  
Galya and everyone arrived in the evening…

May 13

We are migrating.  
Tolik didn’t bring my whiskey and didn’t even say anything…

May 15
Why was I born where I was born, and not as a Nenets in the Arctic? Why am I me? And is it my merit that I am me now? No :) It’s all some kind of invisible math.

May 15

So we arrive in a lifeless tundra, it’s cold, snow is falling — we set up the chum, light the stove, and soon a living space emerges, a home, coziness. And then the reverse happens. The warmth of a human in this cold, boundless world.

May 17

Yesterday we migrated.  
I rode reindeer for the first time.  
Kind of tired.  
Had a wonderful dream.) You journey into a fairytale.  
It was raining — I sweated a lot in my malitsa.

May 17

First, you lose track of the day of the week, then the date, then the month, then the time of the day, and you simply exist in a kind of geometric Solaris.

Sledding, and this whole journey in general, is about accepting the flow of time — it just flows. The Nenets bear this very easily; you shouldn’t be thinking about anything, just be in the proverbial moment. And I noticed that I worried — about what would happen tomorrow, about how much longer we had to ride, about what would happen after returning to the “big world”. To remove the anxiety and just ride, breathe, look.

It’s as if you’re on Mars, the visual scenery is very austere, as if you’re riding inside a minimalist or suprematist painting.

Today I realized that I want to ride again, even though yesterday it was very difficult. It’s raining again today, but there’s no wind, and that’s good.

May 17

> He knew from the experience of the previous winter that, no matter how low the temperature, what mattered for feeling warm was a sharp change, a contrast..

_Kolyma Tales by Varlam Shalamov_

May 17

The migration failed because of a blizzard.  
At the moment when almost all the bulls for riding had been caught, the old man said “cancel”.  
And we set up the chum again.  
An express-version of the chum.  
In a severe blizzard.  
We didn’t bank it with snow — it’s being blown through.  
All the clothes are wet.  
Galya hasn’t lit the stove yet, and I’m dreaming about it.

And I’m also thinking about how Artyom is doing out there. He left alone with the herd two days ago to drive the main herd north. Okay, he’s in a blizzard, but he’s alone... Could I endure four days alone with the reindeer and the white emptiness?  
I want warmth)  
It’s dark. Damp. And cold. 🥶

Yes, I’ve caught a slight cold in my lower body, and now I often need to go to the toilet...  
Strangely, I no longer think about returning earlier, about giving up — have I accepted it, I guess?)  
Right now, even an icy Mars with its temperature seems like a resort to me)  
I have no comfort zone) and my personal space is the box in which my consciousness resides.

May 18

Snowstorm, blizzard, blinding snow, snowdrift — so many words.

May 18

The night was so-so) it was blowing heavily…

May 18

About the cold at night: it begins to seep in like cold mercury, in tiny streams... it is mercury because it’s slow, viscous... into certain places through little holes... at first it tingles, tickles, then it begins to “suck”, the cold tongue of some entity, a god of cold... of the snowstorm... a god of cold dampness, of cold, damp wind...

May 18

If Sevok were a human, he would write poetry. He always walks with me to the tundra, just sits down and gazes into the distance... And he’s also very independent, always alone, he can get offended and sleep outside if he’s scolded too harshly in the chum.

May 18

We migrated.  
The start was in a blizzard.  
Then sun and a light frost.  
I got cold.  
I’ve chilled my lower body and now it hurts when I pee.  
I thought again that I wouldn’t be able to endure it.  
But when we arrived it was a great evening, no wind, a light frost — beautiful.  
And we even opened cognac - Ilyusha arrived by helicopter!)  
When it’s sunny and warm — you want to live))  
And I also started reading the Kolyma Tales.  
I think in these four months I’ll become the coolest drinking buddy — will have stories to tell)

May 18

There is no word “thank you” in the Nenets language, that is, it does not exist at all as a concept, as a mental construct. Language reflects thinking. How does the Nenets think? If someone helped you, did something good, then it’s necessary. This is the norm. And you would have helped and will help. There can be no doubt about it. It’s a given. It’s a man. This is the tundra. Why waste time and energy on unnecessary conversations?

May 19

We migrated.  
At first, there was sunshine and joy during the yorkalava\*, but as soon as we started the migration (around 5 p.m.) — it immediately became overcast, windy, a slight blizzard and cold... I put on my winter malitsa during the process, my feet froze.  
Today we migrate again.) We are moving north non-stop.

\*Yorkalava is the process of catching riding bulls for the argish. First, a corral is built from sleds, then the riding bulls are driven into it, and then from them, the bulls that will be harnessed to the sleds for travel (migration) that day are selected.

May 20

The reindeer have a collective mind, they are like humans: some are afraid, some think they can get away with it, some break through and run away.

May 20

We crossed the railway.  
Again, a cold wind and no sun — it came out for 15 minutes and that’s it.

May 21

A happy day.  
I went out in the morning — it’s warm and sunny.  
And there’s no wind at all, at all...

May 21

The drone is flying over the endless tundra — it seems that we are alone in this meta-Universe...

The past world is somewhere far away now... I think about it less and less), reality has fused together...

May 21

And so the sunny, happy day has passed — in the evening, wind and overcast again), but I am very glad to have had that little happiness.

May 22

We are migrating.  
Yesterday we went to the Yuribey trading post.  
The weather today is changeable: warm, windy, sometimes sunny, sometimes hailing and overcast.

May 22

I feel the blood and the gene of all humanity, of all living things, of the entire world within me.

May 23

We are migrating.  
We will cross the Yuribey.  
A very long route, 25 km.  
Warm, no wind, but overcast.  
Time has slowed down.  
I’m reading Tolstoy right on the sled, on the move — it’s bliss.

May 23

The beginning of spring.  
The smell of Labrador tea on thawed patches.  
Little bird feathers.  
The singing of birds at night — the silence is broken.  
The smell of earth.

May 23

The world has become very small.  
A point in the tundra.  
It’s like a window into the fourth dimension.

May 23

It’s like a monastery and mountaineering combined.)

May 24

We migrated.  
Artyom and I were driving a herd of calves.  
There was a strong wind, and towards the end, a slight blizzard.

May 25

All human culture — Tolstoy, Michelangelo, — all beauty will melt like snowflakes do, because there’s nothing permanent; time will erase all things.

The essence of the world is beauty that is eternally transforming, but not eternal. Eternal transformation. But how do we let go of all attachment and love; how do we stop clinging to snowflakes? And do we, human beings, really need to do so?

May 25

My acceptance levels have soared; I hardly ever think about the future, time or timeframes anymore, I’ve stopped counting days and worrying. I take things one day

at a time. Teatimes are my new time markers. It feels good. I’ve really calmed down.

May 25

My personal space is now restricted to dreams and books. Tundra, too.

May 25

Reindeer are their own society. All different kinds of them in the corral. Leaders. Laymen. Enthusiasts. Who’s the decision-maker? Why do they go exactly where they need to go? For a reindeer humans are like circumstances for us humans. Their actions are ruled by circumstance.

May 25

We didn’t move herd today

We expected a heavy snowstorm, but it didn’t come

There is a snowstorm and heavy wind, but with little snow — it’s a baby snowstorm

Still we decided to stay put and not move — ten cows are still missing, with calves in tow

May 25

It’s snоwing for real now!

May 25

Weather and bad luck does matter here: all calves can perish in a heavy snowstorm. A year’s labor can go down the drain just in one day.

May 25

Reindeer herders are not unlike Russian peasants I’ve read about in books — even affluent ones do not hire help, because they don’t trust hired help, it’s cheaper this way, and also when you do it yourself, you do your best

May 25

Do Nenets really choose this way of life? They don’t choose their identity. Once born a Nenets, a Nenets you will remain; it’s not a nationality, it’s a way of being.

I suppose peasants in the 19th century didn’t choose their way of being either.

May 25

For some reason, right now and here in a closed small group, without communication, in a white, boundless, lifeless and endless tundra, you feel connected to all of humanity and your responsibility for everything. It’s like we’re flying in space in the middle of a lifeless, vast cosmos, and the pale blue dot is so far away that maybe the world is gone. And we have a responsibility to ensure that this fire of collective knowledge does not go out. We may not have books or seeds of cultivated plants with us, but we have genes, and what we know, but do not yet understand or do not remember, our souls are alive. And the children.

And then you realize that we’ve been playing the game so much, and we’re all one, the family, all the humanity.

May 26

Feels like –15 degrees on a morning, May 26th — how come?

May 26

To think about it, is there such thing as personal space at all? What if it’s an illusion of mind, smoke patterns rising from a fire?

May 26

Noon, weather is fine

Not too windy, chilly (but still below zero, the snow isn’t melting), sunny

We’re moving herd 16 km further

May 26

I think about my father and grandfather all the time

May 26

Seems like my new crisis reached a new low over here) there’s no running away from thoughts, from oneself, no silencing the thoughts and no replacing them with people and travel. There’s only me and white emptiness) as for my crisis — I’m thinking about life, youth, I’m regretting life that keeps slipping away) I’m clinging

May 27

Morning weather is fine

May 28

Yesterday we moved herd 22 km further

Today we stay put

Tomorrow we’re moving to the summer sled camp

Strong south wind is blowing

I dreamed of surfing in the ice

May 27

I learned to sleep real tight)

May 28

In this white desert I’ve come to appreciate everything created by humans; I’m full of passion and affection for these treasures created by Tolstoy and many others who wrote and made so much more. And I have time for all this. This is what life is for

May 29

Death happens to other people

May 29

I remember a story of Sam Walton, who inquired about sales in his stores on his deathbed. Galitsky said: I don’t want to be like this. But I thought I understood Walton at the time and said that he was passionate about his business until the very end... I thought so at the time, but then I realized that I was wrong) do sales really matter that much when your life comes to an end? Does it really matter if I open more or less pizza joints, if I’m even more at the top of my game than I am now? Does it? No… living a life — that’s what matters

May 30

Real life is the one you feel with your skin; cold and wind — that’s real life

May 30

Again we decided not to move herd: it’s raining hard, it was foggy during the night and it’s damp now, everything’s gone damp, the sleds including. We’ll wait for the weather to clear. We decided not to cross the next two rivers on ice and take a boat; we’ll stay at the summer sled camp for a week/10 days/fortnight and wait for the ice to break and large floes to go away: when calves cross the river, they can be knocked down dead by these and drown.

We’re moving the chum to a thawed patch or it will be flooded, though we’ve been sleeping in the water for a while now)

May 30

I’ve stopped thinking about the movie, I’m thinking a lot about life now

May 30

I’m lying in a leaky chum wrapped in a yagushka; it’s windy, cold and damp, and I’m thinking: it’s a test, I’m being tested

May 31

Last day of spring) tomorrow comes summer) it’s raining, the temperature is about zero, it’s dank and raining real hard

May 31

Now we must survive and reach the sea!

May 31

When there’s two more months to go and it’s raining, time starts to flow differently and the perception of time changes. Time is relative. It’s a mind thing. Time is intangible. My physiological perception of time has changed.

May 31

Vitya and I love watching Hedgehog in the Fog. It’s incredible. I now feel like The Hedgehog.

> I’m in a river; let the river carry me away, decided the Hedgehog, took a very deep breath — as deep as he could, — and got carried away with the current.

June 2

The hunt begins: June 1, 15:00

The hunt ends: June 2, 11:00

We spent the night in the tundra, slept on the ground

It was incredibly beautiful

June 2

It’s sunny and very warm

Summer has officially begun

Never have I been so happy to see the sun — I felt the urge to worship it, make it a senior deity; it radiated complete happiness and joy, it filled me with desire to live, love, rejoice and sing…

Sun! How beautiful you are!

June 3

The sun didn’t last

Weather is terrible

Rain and wind at +1–2 degrees — worst weather of all) dampness gets to you in no time and soon you’re freezing

Almost peed my pants at night:( cold diuresis

June 3

Feels like the “big outside world” does not exist anymore

June 3

Survival mode again

June 3

Maybe we love the Sun so much because it’s the source of all life

> It comes from somewhere (from the Sun, if it’s the Earth we’re talking about), passes the biosphere and finally returns to space as infrared light. In every separate case of hypothetical alien life that we’ll consider in this book, we’ll start with counting and examining all possible energy sources. In some cases the Mother Star will be the main source.

_Imagined Life: A Speculative Scientific Journey among the Exoplanets in Search of Intelligent Aliens, Ice Creatures, and Supergravity Animals. By Michael Summers_

June 3

Bad weather in spring is better than bad weather in autumn: in autumn it only gets colder by the day, whereas in spring it gets warmer, summer and the sun always await, they’re always there, just further ahead…

June 3

Humanity is nothing but a collective mind. We perceive ourselves as separate. But, like so many other things, it’s an illusion.

June 3

My current world boils down to a group of people:

1. Vlad
2. Galya
3. Tolik
4. Kolya
5. Vitya
6. Ilya
7. Artyom
8. Dasha
9. Nyadma
10. Stas
11. Natasha
12. Alexander
13. Nastya
14. Diana

Me and that’s all)

Overall: 14 + 1 = 15

June 3

A day inside a chum when it’s raining. What’s it like?

Imagine waking up in a dark and cramped room with ten other people and spending all day inside when outside is wet, cold and scary.

June 3

I feel oneness with all things: we’re all one, even stones, we all originated from the Big Bang. I feel like crying. I feel all humans and all the history of humanity.

June 3

Humans created music as well… Music… you can dance — and I dance in the tundra

June 4

I used to notice when it’s been a week since I last washed… I haven’t washed for two months now, lol) and I haven’t even given it another thought

June 4

Body houses the spirit, so body must be preserved/tomorrow I must stop eating so much fatty food and bread and sugar

Tea with two cookies, tops

Hold on, Fedya

June 4

At night our chum almost got blown down by the wind, it was harsh, 15–20 mps, I got cramps again — it hurts to urinate

Then the sun came out and it was awesome

June 5

It was sunny and awesome yesterday

Today is dreary again, wind and rain, Northern wind — Artyom said bad weather will hold for five more days

So hopefully it will clear up for my birthday

I’m lying in the wind again

June 6

It was raining and by late afternoon the sun appeared

June 7

It’s been a sunny day; we’ve cut and dried bread and had a yorkalava practice; later I went to overturned sleds, sat on a hill and reveled in the beauty

June 8

It’s very warm but overcast; morning brought a warm drizzle

June 8

It’s overcast, very warm, still and drizzling; I’ve washed my yellow beanie this morning) Tomorrow we’re moving to the summer sled camp

June 8

All in all I can say that I’ve adapted. Weather matters. I cheer up when it gets warm. Birdsong and no wind bring joy even if there’s no sun)

June 8

I’ve been listening to silence

This silence is like music

June 9

We’re moving to the summer sled camp, but we can’t herd the reindeer) they’ve escaped five times now

It’s warm and still, damp and overcast though

Tomorrow I’m 44.

I lost track of days.

June 10

My 44th birthday

Thoughts?

This travelling experience with all its alone time, absence of distractions and minimalism really just accentuated my crisis)

I thought a lot about the future and the past, but then I woke up this morning and realized that I’ve been living in the moment for a while now — they say it’s not an easy thing to do, but it’s there, you just breathe and live

The Nenets just don’t have time for all this thinking, reading and living… they don’t even have time for love) survival and life takes up all their time. The Nenets wallow in samsara.

June 10

The Nenets don’t celebrate birthdays, it’s considered too personal; they don’t sectionize time, it’s continuously cyclical and therefore eternal and nonexistent

June 10

The Nenets have freedom, but not freedom from the circumstances; they only have freedom from god

June 10

Dreary wet cold

June 11

We stayed put and didn’t move

Inspected summer and winter sleds

Tomorrow we’ll stay put again — we’re waiting for the swell to go down

June 11

Unconditional acceptance of fate eliminates the stress of self-realization. If you are born a Nenets, you will be a Nenets, if you are born a Kshatriya, you will die a Kshatriya. The joy of choosing, finding oneself, and self-realization has a high price in the form of stress and the risk of self-deception and failure)

June 12

Suddenly we’re moving — it wasn’t planned

Crisis again — I’ve been here for too long, I’m tired of this other life. It’s such a rollercoaster.

But when we arrived in the evening, or late at night, I was euphoric) and nicely tired, I rode a reindeer sled all by myself, got lost or abandoned, more precisely( looks like it was someone’s prank…

June 12

The Nenets don’t have a word for thank you

June 13

We stay put and don’t move

Yesterday we arrived at 01:15 and went to sleep around 4 a.m.

Today it’s partly cloudy, sunny and still

Yesterday night (June 13) it was +1

June 14

How ruthless is time, how easily moments slip away; this video is an attempt to catch them. Amazing.

June 14

The Nenets are patience and acceptance personified. Yesterday (June 13) was Tolik’s shift; it is now 13:26 June 14 and Tolik hasn’t yet returned, but when he does, he’ll herd reindeer, move herd and not sleep until early hours… he’ll do it easily and in good spirits. Why live such a life? Patience and acceptance, also extremely low labor productivity that leaves no time for anything else… Tolik is 21, he could be chasing girls, but he’s working hard

June 14

Reindeer herding is much like surfing: you don’t control reindeer, you only adapt to these wild beasts, learn to understand their habits and how they operate — it’s more intuitive than rational experience

June 14

I wonder how the herd makes decisions: one moment they stay put, then move to the corral because one of them did, then another, and then they reach critical mass and all move; or sometimes they walk to the corral and then something happens and they just scatter… If the reindeer refused to go to the corral twice, you should move the corral or change the strategy

June 14

Enlightenment is possible for modern people because they have free time, but how do they use it?

June 14

There are three types of reindeer that go into corral:

1. Those who surrendered
2. Those who wait and see who runs first and where the rest of the herd will go
3. Those who always try to escape

June 14

Every day we uncover the amazing mystery of life; we revel in its beauty but never fully comprehend it

June 15

Sun, rain, the shortest move of all — 3-5km

June 16

How did you look like before you parents were born? Who am I?

June 16

I’m in a state of contemplation; I am the world and the world is me. I love, I cry, I sing.

June 16

> Because of this in Zen nothing beats personal experience. Idea comprehension is impossible for someone with zero personal experience. It’s clear as a day. A child has no ideas, because her mind is yet unable to perceive the world through the lens of conceptual thinking. If a child had ideas, they would probably be totally absurd, ridiculous and out of touch with reality.

_An Introduction to Zen Buddhism. By Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki_

> ...he doesn’t care much for nonexistent details but attempts to intuitively grasp the whole.

_An Introduction to Zen Buddhism. By Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki_

June 16

If the whole world is an illusion and only personal experience can be considered real, then personal experience is the most important thing of all. Not to carry something away or leave something behind, but to live, feel, experience, taste. Adventures. Beauty.

June 16

The world is a snowflake. We get old. We cling to the world with all its breathtaking beauty.

June 16

I’m lying in the chum; the tundra is all rain and wind again, and I’m trying to catch some Zen and joy) Some experiences are driven by ego: I’ve been here. But there’s also experience for the sake of experience. The ultimate experience of all that no one will ever know about.

June 16

> But in reality nothing is attained, and this nothing is exactly what true attainment means.

_An Introduction to Zen Buddhism. By Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki_

June 16

If the world is nothing but suffering and attachment and nothing is ever permanent, but at the same time the world is beautiful like a snowflake that will eventually melt, I want to revel in this beauty, and its impermanence only makes it more beautiful. I want to contemplate the impermanence, the imperfection and non-duality — it’s eternal and momentary. Every moment is momentary and eternal. These moments are all there is — each moment in everyone’s life.

June 16

I’m riding a sled and remembering how I used to lie in the snow when I was a child. I’m not suffering: my childhood feels eternal, it didn’t go away, it is eternal.

June 17

It was raining all night, wind howled, now it’s daytime and raining again, it’s damp.

Rain two days in a row

June 17

The observer effect: not the event itself matters, but how others view it; what matters is the observer, not me, but how I’m perceived.

June 18

Yesterday (June 17) was dreary; all day long it was raining, and then at night the wind came — really heavy and squally northern wind from the sea around 20 mps. It hasn’t subsided since then; we propped up the chum at night, I woke up and covered the holes, and so the day came and went, but the wind hasn’t let up.

June 18

The Nenets never leave the comfort zone because there’s no such thing as comfort zone for them)

June 18

It’s cold, cold penetrating wind is blowing from the harsh ocean, it’s damp and there’s no escape. I need to surrender.

June 18

Somewhere far ahead is the sea that I’m trying to reach

June 18

An ode to the beauty of tundra, this scarce and minimalist place.

June 18

Nighttime

Northern wind 15–20 mps, +4 degrees

June 19

It was sunny, windy and chilly

Moved herd 10 km further

The reindeer they gave me were very wild, I couldn’t move until Alexander tied them up

I cursed a lot (why?)

June 20

We’ll be moving herd soon

We expected better weather

It’s slightly overcast, the sun is peeping, it’s warm and drizzling

June 21

We’re watching animal documentaries with the Nenets.

The questions they ask:

Tolik: Fedya, are penguins edible?

Artyom: What about herons, are they edible?

June 21

They’re neither happy nor unhappy. They just take life as it comes.

June 21

I am reality.

June 21

I revel in this beauty. I listen to the sounds of silence. I drown in them. I cry. I love.

June 21

The beauty of infinity — that’s what tundra is about. It’s about suprematism.

June 23

Yesterday Nadya, Grandma Tanya, Vova and little Egor arrived by helicopter.

Instead of cognac Alik sent some cognac-coloured artificial liquor) 35% alcohol

Dried garlic instead of fresh garlic

Yesterday morning was sultry, sunny, slightly windy; by night the chill came

Today it’s sunny with harsh cold wind, but warm

June 23

Days go by

June 24

It was raining all night and day, the chum flooded, at 15:00 people still haven’t returned from the night shift — obviously something came up. We were going to move herd, but now I don’t think we’re going anywhere today.

I’m walking in the rain; I’m feeling life with my skin.

My side hurts — is it from fatty food? Also at night legs cramped — funny, some say it’s cholesterol)

June 24

Stoicism, Christianity, Buddhism — there’s so much out there, but it’s all a snowflake)

June 24

The Nenets are true stoics

> The single purpose of life is therefore clear: define and separate one thing from the other, so that I could clearly see what is external and beyond my control and what is choice that I can control. Now where do I search for good and evil? Not in external that is beyond my control, but inside, within my own choices.

_The Discourses. 2.5.4-5. By Epictetus_

June 25

First my world reduced, then turned itself inside out and became infinite

June 25

The wind on my face — that’s real life. Soul and body are inseparable; only when you feel pain and touch you feel life. You can’t feel life when you read about feeling. The only thing that matters is momentary experience. The world is a snowflake, but I love it; I don’t want to leave samsara, I want to be inside this Louvre called life, inside this movie, this beautiful simulation. A billion years from now Van Gogh’s legacy will be destroyed by the extinct star, but now it’s here and it’s eternal.

June 26

You can’t escape yourself, can’t buy a ticket, leave, go to a bar — you’re in the tundra

June 26

Nighttime. A huge heavy cloud is approaching us from the Arctic — the Kara Sea sends hi)

June 27

A slight hope for the sun

I’m flowing like a river now, sure and unquestioning — I move because I have to. This is the Nenets way of reasoning. New day came, so you have to get up…

When reindeer don’t have enough grass, they run away

Grass needs sun — everything is connected

June 27

Am I adventurous?

June 27

When the rain ceases, birdsong ceases too.

June 29

Buddha, Jesus, Einstein, Da Vinci and Van Gogh came to exist because humanity ventured, suffered, advanced and perished. Everything belongs to everyone and all is one.

June 29

I don’t know is the key phrase, but Zen Buddhists simultaneously know and don’t know)

June 30

For a Nenets beautiful means practical, neat, bright.

June 30

Sunny day

Tomorrow we cross the Mordyyakha River
