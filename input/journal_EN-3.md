July 1

Life now is constant intrigue, every day a fresh start

Only life and experience matters

July 2

Without reindeer the Nenets die

July 2

You want to do something — leave, escape, change — but you can’t. You can only accept what is. The tundra is boundless.

July 2

Never again shall I eat raw fish

July 3

I wish no one knew my name

I wish no one could ever find me

I’m ash and dust, I’m nothing

My box is never checked because there’s no me

July 3

Surfing is a mystical experience

Pure art attempts to express mystical experience; all life can be a mystical experience, its walls are thin, seeping light…

July 4

Smartphones should be really a presence in the movie — they’re everywhere, they’re omnipresent. Blood, meat and smartphones — people just don’t change at all.

Bread and circuses.

June 4

The rule of the tundra: all that can be lost will be lost

July 5

There’s only one purpose in life: exploring, creating, being free

July 5

An ancient law of life created by God: Earn your bread by the sweat of your brow, be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth.

July 5

Fyodor, only here among strangers you can find yourself. But nothing can fill you in this sterile wilderness; you can’t escape yourself.

July 5

Life is a knife; you want to walk the blade. Sharp blade. Grandpa Vasya is sharpening the knife.

July 6

I’m riding in the tundra and thinking

Having placed myself in a totally different environment, suspended between two worlds without a chance to escape and flood myself with impressions and news that modern world continuously feeds us, I have no choice other than dive into existential questions and stay inside the vessel.

July 7

Many hours of riding, floating in and out of trance and memories, drowning in memories so deep I even remember smells from my childhood

A museum of personal memories: I’m in Syktyvkar, I’m lying in the snow, it’s night, I’m looking at the high-rises. Anticipating holidays, the smell of spring and freedom, my first cigarette. Women’s hips are the most beautiful thing in the world.

July 7

Survival in the tundra depends on knowledge, good clothes and women)

July 7

What’s great about this journey is that I’m learning to walk again; I feel like a fool again

July 10

I’m scared, I don’t want to die

I wish I was a woodworm

I would live inside the back leg of the chair in the far room

And waves would run above my head

I wish no one knew my name

I wish no one could ever find me

I’m ash and dust, I’m nothing

My box is never checked because there’s no me

July 11

People have been using choppers for a million years; hundreds of generations have lived, ventured and died so that we could reach our current level of existence

They died and explored

Do Nenets really differ than much from Russians?

No

July 12

I woke up in fisherman Ivan’s chum

Artyom hasn’t picked me up

As for the weather, it’s overcast and windy, gloomy and around 10–12 degrees

9 a.m., I’m in a stranger’s chum, the alarm went off a couple of minutes ago, but no one’s waking up

I got wet yesterday when I was fishing and waiting for Artyom; I hung my clothes out to dry in the wind

July 12

When I was little, I didn’t want to lead an ordinary life. And look at my life now.

July 12

Zen is completely natural, it’s flow without any duality. Being yourself. Removing all artificial boundaries

July 13

By beauty the Nenets mean functionality and effectiveness

July 13

I wish I could drink up all music created by humanity

July 14

When I was a child I enjoyed life all the time, every moment was fun and bright and full of ambience) even in Syktyvkar with its car sheds and rain

July 14

In this other life you’re totally detached from context, from everyday routine, and it allows for a change in perspective

July 15

One should really read Russian classics as an adult. I’m reading Crime and Punishment: what a great book.

July 18

Books provide an escape from reality, allow to travel to another world, which in essence isn’t a far cry from drugs and daydreaming. But it’s amazing that you can carry a whole world with you. A world that is so delicious. Tangible.

July 18

Dostoevsky’s world is definitely broken.

July 18

I’ve lost track of camps, I don’t remember where we’ve been and when. Life is a constant motion

July 18

What will I remember? What treasures will I bring home from the tundra?

Fragrant tea in a warm chum on a frosty day

My bare feet touching kisa fur, my hands caressing a yagushka, the warmth…

People…

Good people, laughter

How they educated and supported me

July 18

Sometimes calling the “other world” after a long break is hard and even scary — what if something comes up and pulls me out of this warm fresh world

July 18

The essence and taste of life is in anticipating the new and the unknown — spring or summer, another school year, life… and the purpose is to never lose this freshness, though new is so relative — every leaf on an autumn tree is new, every day is new, every look people cast at us and every breath

July 18

I’m still reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky. From the first pages I’ve abhorred Raskolnikov: how narcissistic he is, how weak and self-deceiving. Also selfish. And spoiled.

July 19

Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova is awesome. I think I’m in love with her.

July 19

Crime and Punishment is the greatest psychological crime thriller.

July 19

The smell of burning plastic bags reminds me of childhood — burning trash cans, how we played Star Wars by setting a plastic bag on fire and dripping melting plastic into puddles behind the sheds) God it was fun) Looks like in essence I haven’t changed at all

July 20

I can now smell moments. I’ve become more attentive. We lack attentiveness. The right kind of attentiveness. It’s hard to explain: with this kind of attentiveness everything comes into sharper focus. It is as if you adjust focus in a camera and everything became clearer, more transparent, tactile and sharp.

July 20

20 days left. So little. It feels different. I know that I’ll go and they’ll stay

July 20

+5–6 degrees

Heavy wind

Dampness

Question: is it summer yet?

Or is summer already over?

July 20

Strange that Raskolnikov does not in the least care about the old pawnbroker or Lisa(

I was sorry for the old pawnbroker, so fragile, thin-haired, well, yes she is evil, but ignorantly so… she does deserve love and pity

I wish I could hug and kiss this old pawnbroker; I so desperately want that

July 20

I suppose it’s not a good idea to read Russian classics at school — you’ve read it but you haven’t really. How can a 13- or 14-year-old grasp Crime and Punishment? Even at 15 or 17 it’s hard.

July 20

Sex in Dostoevsky’s novels is virtually nonexistent, neither literal, nor in atmosphere, e.g. in descriptions of female characters. The opposite is true for Tolstoy: sex is a real presence in his novels, remember the upturned moustached lip?

Extremely lewd — what is meant by that?

> This man was also very unlikeable and obviously extremely lewd, undoubtedly cunning and deceptive and maybe even evil.

_Crime and Punishment. By Fyodor Dostoevsky_

July 21

> he passed from thought to daydreaming and contemplation

_Crime and Punishment. By Fyodor Dostoevsky_

It’s all about one thing - both Zen and Dostoevsky are fundamentally the same.

July 21

> They wished they could talk, but they couldn’t. Tears blurred their eyes. Both were pale and thin, but these pale thin faces carried a glimpse of new dawn and complete resurrection into a new life. Love was what resurrected them, and the heart of one held infinite sources of life for the heart of other.

> But he resurrected and he knew that, his whole renewed being spoke of that, and as for her — she lived for him only!

_Crime and Punishment. By Fyodor Dostoevsky_

Isn’t this new life and resurrection the same as satori and enlightenment? After that even suffering stops being suffering… Samsara is nirvana, but from a different perspective.

July 21

> That night, however, he was unable to have any long or continuous thoughts; he couldn’t concentrate, and anyway, it was too late to consciously decide on anything; now he could only feel. Instead of duality there was now life, and the mind had to operate in a completely different way.

_Crime and Punishment. By Fyodor Dostoevsky_

What is that if not Zen and non-duality? And why do I see Zen Buddhism in all things? Lol

> But here starts a different story: a story of a gradual renewal of a man, his gradual rebirth and transference from one world to another; the acquaintance with a new and previously unknown reality. It could be a theme for our new narrative, but as for this one, it’s now done.

_Crime and Punishment. By Fyodor Dostoevsky_

July 21

Comprehending means simplifying (!)

July 21

Unless you let go of the observer effect — the constant construction of the context me — society — other people — you’ll keep separating yourself from others, which is the root of all ego. You separate yourself from the world. This modern world allowed us to construct a virtual self via Instagram, to create an image inside an image, an illusion inside an illusion, and now we care not only about how we look, but also about how our image/narrator is perceived on Instagram. Technical progress doesn’t matter as long as all the important questions are solved in the mind, and they’re still the same. Progress does affect us, sure it does — more and more people can think about something other than food now. The observer effect creates duality; the perception of the world as non-dual and perception of oneself as inseparable and one with the world is the way to Zen and enlightenment. It is what children and animals (possibly) have, it’s a flow — a flow of life. Another quality. Only by shedding the observer effect one can lead a different life, a Zen life.

True artists don’t care if no one ever sees their work?

July 21

One must simply accept the flow of life. Not think about living, but live)

July 21

Absolute reality is beyond words

July 23

The Nenets love children and pretty names — Carolina, Diana, Marta, Carina… children are fulfillment, eternity and immortality

children are immortality

July 24

What motivates Logan Roy? What’s it like to be Logan Roy?

July 25

> 1. You can’t win (you can’t get something when you have nothing; law of conservation of matter and energy)
> 2. You can’t play a draw (return to a previous energy state, because chaos and entropy are ever increasing)
> 3. You can’t quit the game (absolute zero is unattainable).

_Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension. By Michio Kaku_

July 25

Entropy is fast

> It took almost 5000 years for the migrating hunter groups to become the great Aztek civilization that had flourished in Mexico and Central America and created magnificent monuments to gods. But it took several months for Cortez and Сonquistadors to wipe out the Aztec civilization.

_Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension. By Michio Kaku_

July 25

> Father casually mentions that stars will eventually perish; the children are having a tantrum. “Please don’t let the stars die!” — they pray. Placating them, father asks AK whether it’s possible to reverse entropy. “You see”, — he says, having read the answer. “AK can do anything”. Comforting the kids, he adds: “When time comes, AK will take care of everything”. Father doesn’t mention that the computer really said: “Not enough data for a complete answer”.

_Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension. By Michio Kaku_

Buddha sat in honourable silence…

July 25

The passage of time without arbitrary markers like days of the week or “days off” changed my perception of time: it now flows continuously.

July 25

Must check what Michio Kaku looks like

July 26

Watching a snowflake melt — that’s the meaning of life for you. It’s very personal. And very selfish.

Loving a snowflake with every cell.

July 27

I always empathize with people in broken glasses, especially alcoholics who have lost their glasses and can’t find the way.

I wish I could go search for my lost glasses. Much like Holden Caulfield.

July 27

You mustn’t really lose things in the tundra; you mustn’t own a lot of things and you mustn’t lose them. Each things serves you for many years, has its own time and history

July 27

Never postpone the footage — second chance may not come

July 27

I started to recognize our reindeer. The Nenets are around reindeer all the time: they grow up with them, get old with them, suffer alongside them. No wonder they know what each deer looks like

July 28

The Nenets do not like to plan ahead — they play by the ear and reason like this: if I’m strong, I’ll handle everything

July 28

I began to understand all scenarios simultaneously, not just the preferred one in my head

July 28

> …and that doctor there, why, what does he know about seafaring men? I have been in places hot as pitch, and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes—what do the doctor know of lands like that?—and I lived on rum, I tell you.

_Treasure Island. By Robert Louis Stevenson_

July 28

Camps change — they’re different but the same — we move all the time but it feels like we don’t. Change is gradual

July 29

The main question is: what if I don’t want nirvana?

Let’s say I agree with everything that the yogacharins have discovered: I am an artificial construct, but at the same time I accept that I consciously choose to play this game) I do not deny the logic of Buddhism, I rather agree with the conclusions and disagree with them at the same time.

July 29

Mortality is beautiful and vital; eternity is ugly and cold.

July 30

God how I love these people, I love them warmly and truly

July 29

> The late yogacharins recognize two sources of cognition — sensory perception (pratyaksha) and logical inference (anumana), and only sensory perception contains an element of correct knowledge about reality as it is, whereas logical inference can provide knowledge only in relation to the level of relative truth.

_An Introduction to Buddhism. By Evgeny Alekseevich Torchinov_

Art is sensory perception!

July 29

> Reality as such is not semiotic, because language (in the broadest sense) is only a convention, the ancient vasana).

_An Introduction to Buddhism. By Evgeny Alekseevich Torchinov_

July 30

> Look around, see what is around you, try to stop the flow of mental debris in your head, and you will be able to see the plan of God that lies behind all things.

_Syrian mystics about love, fear, anger and joy. By Maxim Glebovich Kalinin, Philip Viktorovich Dziadko_

July 30

There is knowledge and there is experience

July 30

I’m a different person now.

July 30

Alcohol brings “enlightenment”) it’s artificial, but the whole world seems beautiful

July 31

What are my takeaways from this journey? Firstly, it’s possible not to have sex for four months) and not even think much about it, so it seems that consciousness does define existence after all) Well, I did think about it, but not obsessively

July 31

Fear of the unknown — who said that death awaits after death? We’re just afraid of the unknown. We’re making everything up. The only reality is now.

July 31

I feel the sea 25 kilometers away — the wind, the moisture, the fog, the clouds; I think I can hear seagulls — it’s truly the edge of the earth

July 31

Unseeingly and unwittingly we’re all connected to olden times… It’s in our superstitions and instincts... The Nenets have it stronger than we do, they feel it as an umbilical cord leading back to ancient times.

August 1

Uqnum/qanum is an independent existence, literally “self”. Syrian mystics often talk about seeing the beauty of their uqnum, which happens in a true encounter with oneself. When a person is sure that he is living his true life, he lets go of the need to compete with others.

Syrian mystics about love, fear, anger and joy. By Maxim Glebovich Kalinin, Philip Viktorovich Dziadko

A true encounter with oneself.

August 1

> Travel as a mystical experience. Life in general is a mystical experience. 
> Rawwayuta — “intoxication”; one of the words used by the Syrian mystics to denote the ecstatic side of spiritual experience.

_Syrian mystics about love, fear, anger and joy. By Maxim Glebovich Kalinin, Philip Viktorovich Dziadko_

It seems I’ve had a rawwayuta here :)

August 1

You have to concentrate in order not to lose things, because they are valuable and the further you take them, the more history they aссumulate, but if you lose them, let it be so. It means that you had to lose this particular thing: its time had come.

August 1

This particular grass, this particular stone — I’m lying down and looking at them, and then I realize that I’m thinking in concepts, not particularities. There are so many things that we just don’t see... at this moment, but here this grass is growing, this piece of land lives its own life... attention to detail…

The fate of flowers.

August 1

Nenets definitely don’t all speak in words. They speak with deeds and attitudes. This is an understanding without words.

August 2

I’m not in a rush anymore; time just flows like a river and I don’t attempt to outrun the current.… And it’s not just the speed of movement that counts

August 2

The Nenets economics is an effective self-sufficient system for maintaining life in harsh conditions, where even animals find it difficult to exist. Humans are truly amazing. The kaleidoscope.

August 3

If I did touch it at all, I did it with the very tip of my tongue. Just a little bit. I licked it, so to say. This is my limit for now. The most important thing is that I don’t want to go further consciously. I don’t want to leave this beautiful samsara.

It all comes from childhood, I’m sure. Mom, why am I me? Who am I? What is my identity? experiencing the uniqueness of a concrete block in a panel house, of every pebble on the road — the whole world will keep on going, and the pebble will still be there when I die

The difference between philosophy and something is that philosophy is knowledge on the shelf, and something for me is experience and vision.

August 3

Death is worth living

August 4

The world is a spectacle. Suddenly everything I thought to be real became just a backdrop. I thought it was so serious. But the tundra taught me that it was all a backdrop.

August 4

The Nenets have a powerful instinct for life and an absence of doubt, at least outward. They have a lot of energy. Their instinct is to act.

There is no time to think — the deer must go forward, otherwise they will scatter and die. Deer are everything.

August 6

The enlightenment — satori — changes one’s configurations and a man whose configurations change transforms permanently, changes his thinking and uproots the foundations.

August 7

I used to think that anything that doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Your whole life prepares you for something bigger. This thought inspired me. It seemed that everything was not in vain. And then I lost the meaning of it. Realized that the purpose is not absolute. Now everything is different)

August 7

They want to find direct answers, but there aren’t any. It’s grasping the air. A search for virtual constructions. I need to pass on direct experience.

August 7

Why did I come here? To figure out human life and existence. Experience — observation — research. We see things from one perspective, but I wanted to climb another hill and see things from the opposite river bank. There are no direct answers, and I did not come here to find them. But I definitely understood a lot. My configurations are changing as I speak. The straightforward simple answer is too simple and only brings incomprehension.

August 7

Reaching the last sea

They say: You’re doing this to become even stronger and achieve something, but I think I know what lies beyond that last frontier… reaching the last sea

August 12

Who am I?

The continuum. The river.

I think of myself 10 years ago and now and I realize that I’ve changed and I’m alone.

Death no longer scares me?

There are things that I physically can’t tell you. We underestimate the observer effect.

While I was speaking, the snowflake has melted.
